jammod v1.0 README
==================

What is jammod?
---------------

jammod is a program which loads a Linux kernel module without support
from the kernel. It does not appear in the module list (lsmod,
/proc/modules). To accomplish this, jammod writes the module file
directly into kernel memory (/dev/kmem) and links it. As you might
imagine, fiddling with kernel memory is not very nice - don't use
jammod on boxes you don't want to see crashing now and then.

jammod is currently only implemented for i386 Linux. It has been
tested on Debian Sarge running on a Linux 2.6.0 kernel.


Installation
------------

Run "make" to compile. You need the following stuff for that:
- GNU make
- gcc (I used 3.3.3)
- Linux kernel headers (2.6.0 here)

Install the resulting binary "./src/jammod" on your system, e.g. in
/usr/local/sbin.


Using jammod

XXX: to be written


Why?
----

Because I Can (TM)

This is a proof-of-concept software to demonstrate that disabling
module support in the kernel does not really improve
security. Removing /dev/kmem support from the kernel does (AFAIK you
need to patch the kernel sources to do that). No idea why there is
this /dev/kmem feature, who ever needed this except SucKIT?

This is a tool, and it is available to everyone, if you like it or
not. If I hadn't written it, someone else would do it. Tools are not
bad; the hacker who rooted your server and used it to cover his tracks
might be called "bad". Damnit, now you wish you had applied all those
security upgrades.


Greetings

Greetings to my friend MocI with whom I sat in a bar in Cologne
drinking cocktails, while I had the idea to write this program.
